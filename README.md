# Force learner

### Force learner is a way to force you to learn
I had been asked by my french teacher to create an application to force me to learn french words, and here it is!\
\
![Example of it in action](images/example.gif)
\
This appliation forces you to write down the meanings of words which are defined in a **wordlist**. By default, it will refer to the wordlist on this repository (https://github.com/biegaj/force-learner/blob/main/wordlist.txt). \
You may edit this to your own repository to implement your own words. It will loop around words randomly. 
```
Key: Value 
``` 
You must define what word you want and what value it has. For example, 'bonjour: hello' will be seen as:\
*"What does 'bonjour' mean" to where the end user must input 'hello'*
